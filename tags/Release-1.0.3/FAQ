Q: The application runs and then exits when finished. How do I have it check
   for new episodes and download them regularly?
A: Use cron or another daemon to execute scheduled commands.
   Here is an example for cron to run everday at 3 AM:

    $ crontab -e
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    HOME=/home/user
    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    0 3 * * * pgrep niw-podcast-downloader || niw-podcast-downloader 2> $HOME/.niw-podcast-downloader/errors.txt


Q: How do I have all episodes for all podcasts marked as downloaded? For
   instance, I'm moving from one podcast downloader to this one.
A: Use the --init command line option.


Q: I've added a new podcast to my podcasts.xml file. How do I keep from
   downloading every episode?
A: Set the <init> tag in the item in the podcasts.xml file. Run the application
   then remove the <init> tag. The <init> tag will set the specific podcast
   to init mode where it will not download but mark all episodes as downloaded.


Q: When would it be necessary to disable platform specific functionality?
A: When using a supported platform that does not support the features.
   For Example: on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and other Unix, the statvfs function
   from sys/statvfs.h is used to determine the free disk space. If this
   funciton is unavailable the platform specific code will not work correctly
   (if it even compiles). Thus, on some systems disabling this code may be
   requried.


Q: If the platform specific code is platform specific, than why would it be
   enabled on a platform that doesn't really support it?
A: The platform checks are fairly stupid. They just check for the platform type
   not the specific platform or version.


Q: Which platforms does the platform specific code check for and what versions
   work with it?
A: Checks:
     * Unix
     * Window
   Known to work:
     * Linux
     * Window >= 2000 Professional
   Should work:
     * Other Unix
   Please notify the author if you find a Unix system (not listed) that the
   platform specific codes works or doesn't work on.
